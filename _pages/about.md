Hi, my name is Artem Aguichine, and I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC).

I am a planetary scientist, and my research spans a broad range of topics related to planet formation, evolution, and interior structure. I focus on characterizing the properties and composition of (exo)planets through theoretical approaches and numerical modeling.

I am particularly interested in the distribution of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHNOPS'>volatile species</a> in our Solar System, and the presence of water in <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/an0wen/an0wen.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/img/sub-Neptunes.png'>sub-Neptunes</a>. My research advances the field of astrobiology, shedding light on the distribution of life throughout planetary systems and the origin of life in our own Solar System.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
